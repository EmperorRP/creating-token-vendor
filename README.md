# Creating a Crypto Token Vendor (theweekndcoin)
I created a decentralized token that can be used for transactions through a challenge from Scaffold-Eth
This is the solution for the challenge 2 of Scaffold Eth - creating a token vendor. This particular code passes all the given 6 tests and has been accepted by [speedrunethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
